            <h4 class="text-center">What is our Advocacy about?</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">"Let’s Shake It Up" is a student-led advocacy campaign aligned with SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being, aimed at providing free, healthy shakes to individuals (both students and faculty) near La Salle Dasmarinas who may be struggling with stress, anxiety, or depression. By distributing at least 50 free shakes made with natural ingredients such as real mangoes and muscovado sugar, the campaign promotes both mental and physical health. Alongside the shakes, a sticky note activity encourages recipients to express their thoughts, fostering a sense of community and emotional release. With an expected budget of ₱5000, the initiative relies on volunteers, sponsorships, and efficient resource management to ensure sustainability. The campaign will take place on March 28, 2025, at Food Square, De La Salle Dasmarinas, and aims to inspire future Lasallians to continue this act of kindness for years to come</p>

            <h4 class="text-center">Why did we conduct this advocacy</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">here are studies that show that college students in the Philippines are 2 to 3 times more at risk of suffering mental health issues such as anxiety and depression compared to the general population (Alibudbud, 2021). Faculty members and professors are also susceptible to mental health issues (Orlanda-Ventayen, 2021).  That’s why the advocates have decided to conduct a multimodal advocacy campaign (MAC), in order to raise awareness, and help alleviate or lessen the risk of mental health issues in Filipino college students more specifically at De la Salle University Dasmarinas City, Cavite. In fact there are studies that show college students who have higher levels of social interaction and participation in school activities provided by student organizations have higher quality of life and lower risk for depression and anxiety (Cleofas, 2019). </p>
            <p class="text-justify">That’s why it’s the advocate's vision to bring comfort and hope to struggling individuals near De La Salle Dasmarinas through this small act of kindness. And the advocates can reach this goal by achieving the mission of providing free shakes as a simple way to uplift those struggling while promoting mental health awareness and support. In accordance with United Nations SDG 3. The advocate’s also plan to have a sticky note activity to help the participants express their feelings and thoughts. Helping them vent out their stress, and fostering a sense of community within the campus.             </p>

            <h4 class="text-center">Campaign Details</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The campaign will utilize multimodal communication such as having customized plastic cups plastered with the "Let’s Shake It Up" logo, ensuring brand visibility and creating a cohesive identity for the advocacy. How we will go through that is with waterproof sticky paper. Additionally, a 2x4 feet tarpaulin will be prominently displayed at the distribution stand, featuring the campaign name, logo, and key details. This tarpaulin will serve as a visual anchor, drawing attention to the initiative and reinforcing its message of promoting mental and physical well-being.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">To amplify the campaign’s reach, the next multimodal communication is a social media campaign under the hashtag #LetsShakeItUp will be launched. Posts will include promotional materials, behind-the-scenes preparation videos, and updates about the event. The sticky note activity will also be highlighted, encouraging online engagement by sharing photos of the sticky notes and stories from participants. This digital effort will not only raise awareness but also foster a sense of community and support, extending the campaign’s impact beyond the physical event. By leveraging social media, the campaign aims to inspire a wider audience to join the movement and advocate for mental health awareness.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Financial support for the campaign will come from local businesses and potential school grants, which will help cover the costs of ingredients, packaging, and other necessary materials. This collaborative effort between volunteers and sponsors ensures the campaign’s success and sustainability.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">The key personnel for the "Let’s Shake It Up" campaign include advocacy members and interested students who will handle the preparation, distribution, and engagement activities. These volunteers will ensure the smooth execution of the campaign, from making the shakes to interacting with recipients and managing the sticky note activity. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Lastly, the campaign will use fresh mangoes, muscovado sugar, fat-free milk, water, and ice to create delicious and nutritious shakes. The mangoes will be peeled, sliced, and blended with the other ingredients using a blender provided by advocacy members. Once smooth, the mixture will be poured into cups and served with straws. To ensure cleanliness and safety, all ingredients will be handled with sanitized gloves, hairnets, and masks throughout the preparation process.</p>
